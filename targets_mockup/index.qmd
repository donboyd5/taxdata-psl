# Introduction

This website demonstrates a prototype, in R, of a way to get targets for enhanced-PUF variables from IRS spreadsheets. It creates a csv file with a large number of potential targets. I do not expect that we will target all of them, but rather will choose a subset of them to target.

I envision that in the short term we will use the results of this program, but that in the longer run Nikhil will develop a python approach to getting targets, do doubt better than this, although perhaps he will start by translating this code to python.

The basic steps are:

-   A, B, C

-
