# Introduction

This website compares the evolving PolicyEngine flat file for 2023 to the current taxdata flatfile for 2023.

The basic steps are:

-   Construct a variant of the taxdata file that only has the variables that are in the PE file.

-   Stack the 3 files and put an indicator on each record in the stacked file giving its source:

    -   The PE file

    -   The taxdata file that has the same variables as the PE file

    -   The full taxdata file, which includes all input and output variables

-   Replace missing values with zeros (this only affects variables that were not in an initial version of a file - all initial files had nonmissing values for all records for all variables initially included).

-   Run the stacked file through Tax-Calculator. Add back the record identifiers to the output file.

-   Analyze the resulting output file. Although most analysis is of initial variables rather than calculated variables, running the file through Tax-Calculator was important because it constructs AGI, which is an important classifier for distributional analysis.

-   The R code that does the above [is on GitHub](https://github.com/donboyd5/taxdata-psl) in the pe_flatfile folder.
